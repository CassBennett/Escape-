# Escape! An Audio Only Horror Game

This project includes the source code, Visual Studio Solution, and sound files needed to run this application. 
The project uses Allan Milne's Audio Framework with classes such as XASound and GameTimer in order to create sounds and manage gameplay for the game. Credit has been given where this is the case.
The executable of this application can be downloaded from: https://cassbennett.itch.io/escape.

(Note: Github was not used as source control for this project, but is being used to host the code samples)
